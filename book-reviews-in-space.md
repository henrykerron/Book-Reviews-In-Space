### Overview

You're going to be building a website like
[goodreads.com](http://www.goodreads.com/) so astronauts can post books and review them.

### Prerequisites

** The Rails guides are an excellent resource for many of the questions that may come up in this assignment:
[Getting Started with Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)**

### Learning Objectives

- Build a basic Rails app
- Learn how to implement the Devise gem
- Practice using Rails routes
- Practice using Rails form helpers
- Practice using Active Record associations
- Practice TDD

### Hints
Draw an ER diagram for your app first.

Then, implement the [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) gem to generate the User model for you. After installing Devise, you will have to add a column "role" to your Users table. The default role is "candidate" which a user can later update to "astronaut." Feel free to experiment and add any other fields you think make sense (maybe "favorite book" or "favorite author," for example).

Work through the rest of the user stories once you have implemented Devise.

Write tests for your features!
